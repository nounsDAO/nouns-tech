# Noun Protocol Specification

## Simple Summary

Simply describe the outcome of the change. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.

## Abstract

A short (~200 word) description of the change, the abstract should clearly describe the change. This is what _will_ be done if it is implemented, not _why_ it should be done or _how_ it will be done.

## Technical Specification

The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Nouns currently exposes or the creation of new ones. Clearly describe _how_ to implement the specification.
